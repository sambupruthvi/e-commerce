Disadvantages of using a file system as data store to store a json file:
    ->Will error if we try to open/write to the same file twice at the same time.
    ->Won't work if we have multiple servers running on different machines.
    ->We have to write to the FS everytime we want to update some data.

2 very popular approachs for managing data for web applications:
Repository approach
    A single class (Repository) is responsible for data access. All records are stored and used as plain JS objects

Active Record approach
    Every record is an instance of a 'model' class that has methods to save, update, delete this record.

constructors in js are usually synchronous and should not be made async
    they also should not contain async code in it

JSON.stringfy(objects, function, indentation)


methods that are required are shown in documentation.md
