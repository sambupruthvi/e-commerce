Disadvantages of using a file system as data store to store a json file:
    ->Will error if we try to open/write to the same file twice at the same time.
    ->Won't work if we have multiple servers running on different machines.
    ->We have to write to the FS everytime we want to update some data.

2 very popular approachs for managing data for web applications:
Repository approach
    A single class (Repository) is responsible for data access. All records are stored and used as plain JS objects

Active Record approach
    Every record is an instance of a 'model' class that has methods to save, update, delete this record.

constructors in js are usually synchronous and should not be made async
    they also should not contain async code in it

JSON.stringfy(objects, function, indentation)


methods that are required are shown in documentation.md


Handling Authentication:
    Request cookies:
        When we make a request to a server, server responds back to request with a cookie. A cookie is small string of characters. Please include this with every followup request you make to me.
        Then the browser requests with cookies.

Cookie library
    cookie-session is also a middle ware function like body-parser.

We use express-validator to validate the inputs from the user, before we validate we sanitize the user inputs.
express-validator is a middleware
the results from the validator is going to attach the results of all this validation to the request object that is going to eventually flow into our request handler, so in order to get access to all that validation logic or the output of it we are passing in the req object.

mapped() whenever mapped is applied to an array, it returns an object.
